# Memory Optimization Work - Future Reference

## Problem Summary
- CitrixTranscriber was consuming ~4GB of memory at startup when idle
- Models were being eagerly loaded for instant response times but caused excessive memory usage
- Memory consumption breakdown:
  - Default LLM (Qwen3-8B-4bit): ~4-5GB
  - ASR Model (Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v2): ~2.5GB  
  - Vosk Model: ~100MB
  - Total: ~6.6GB+ memory allocation

## Solutions We Implemented (Rolled Back)

### 1. Configuration-Based Memory Management
- Added `MEMORY_MANAGEMENT` section to `config.py`
- Created memory profiles: `high_performance`, `balanced`, `memory_saver`, `minimal`
- Configurable lazy loading, model unload timeouts, memory thresholds

### 2. Lazy Loading System
- Modified model loading in `main.py`, `llm_handler.py`, `transcription_handler.py`
- On-demand model loading instead of startup preloading
- Usage tracking and automatic cleanup after timeouts

### 3. Audio Buffer Optimization
- Limited `_voiced_frames` buffer to 30 seconds (600 frames)
- Progressive cleanup at 60 seconds, emergency cleanup at 2.5 minutes
- ASR model auto-cleanup after transcription sessions

### 4. Memory Optimizer Tool
- Created `src/memory_optimizer.py` with CLI interface
- Commands for applying profiles, monitoring memory usage
- NPM scripts: `npm run start:optimized`, `npm run memory:status`

### 5. Expected Results
- Memory_saver profile: ~500MB startup (87% reduction from 4GB)
- Models load on-demand in 10-30 seconds
- Automatic cleanup during idle periods

## Issues That Need Investigation

### 1. Functionality Problems (Why We Rolled Back)
- Application didn't work as expected after implementation
- Need to debug:
  - Model loading delays causing UI freezes?
  - Transcription accuracy issues?
  - Audio processing interruptions?
  - IPC communication timing problems?

### 2. Known Issues to Address
- **Microphone Conflicts**: Extensive `AUDIO_CONFLICT` messages in logs
  - Safari/Chrome competing for microphone access
  - Blue circle shows listening but no audio data received
  - Silent audio frames (amplitudes 0-44) indicate another app using mic

### 3. Memory Issues During Active Use
- Even without LLM, transcription still used 4GB+
- Unbounded audio buffer growth during long dictation sessions
- Memory fragmentation from large models + accumulated audio
- No cleanup between dictation sessions

## Files That Were Modified (Now Restored)
- `main.py` - Model loading logic
- `src/config/config.py` - Memory management config
- `src/audio/audio_handler.py` - Buffer optimization
- `src/llm/llm_handler.py` - Lazy loading
- `src/transcription_handler.py` - Model cleanup
- `package.json` - NPM scripts
- Frontend files - Memory status UI
- Settings files - Profile configurations

## Next Steps for Future Work

### Phase 1: Gentle Optimization
1. Start with minimal changes - just the audio buffer limits
2. Test thoroughly before adding lazy loading
3. Keep existing model preloading but add cleanup timers

### Phase 2: Incremental Lazy Loading
1. Implement lazy loading for one model at a time
2. Start with least critical model (Vosk)
3. Add proper loading indicators in UI
4. Test each change extensively

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Memory pressure detection
2. Configurable profiles
3. Memory monitoring tools
4. Auto-profile switching based on system resources

### Debugging Priorities
1. **Fix microphone conflicts first** - this affects core functionality
2. **Test memory changes in isolation** - one change at a time
3. **Add proper error handling** for model loading failures
4. **Implement loading states** in UI to avoid confusion
5. **Profile memory usage patterns** during normal use

## Important Notes
- The original codebase (before optimization) is functional
- Memory usage is high but system works reliably
- Any optimization must maintain 100% functionality
- Consider if 4GB memory usage is actually a problem for target users
- Focus on fixing microphone conflicts before optimizing memory

## Testing Strategy for Future Work
1. Baseline testing with original code
2. Memory profiling during different usage patterns
3. Incremental changes with rollback plan
4. User acceptance testing for each major change
5. Performance benchmarking (response times, accuracy)

## CRITICAL BUG FIX APPLIED (Dec 26, 2024)

### Issue: LLM Not Processing After Transcription
**Problem**: After rolling back memory optimization changes, transcription worked but LLM was not summarizing/processing the transcribed text.

**Root Cause**: The LLM handler was not being initialized with saved model settings from `user_settings.json` during startup. Models were only configured when frontend sent `APPLY_CONFIG` commands.

**Fix Applied**: Modified `main.py` Application `__init__` method to:
```python
# Initialize LLM Handler with saved model settings
saved_proofing_model = settings_manager.get_setting("selectedProofingModel", config.DEFAULT_LLM)
saved_letter_model = settings_manager.get_setting("selectedLetterModel", config.DEFAULT_LLM)
saved_proofing_prompt = settings_manager.get_setting("proofingPrompt", config.DEFAULT_PROOFREAD_PROMPT)
saved_letter_prompt = settings_manager.get_setting("letterPrompt", config.DEFAULT_LETTER_PROMPT)

# Configure LLM with saved settings
self.llm_handler.update_selected_models(saved_proofing_model, saved_letter_model)
self.llm_handler.update_prompts(saved_proofing_prompt, saved_letter_prompt)
```

**Result**: LLM should now properly process transcribed text using the saved model configurations from user settings.

**Lesson**: Always ensure component initialization includes loading of persistent configuration, not just defaults.
